<h2>Configuration Sections</h2>

<p>

<h2>Section 1 - Intro to URLs and Admin Panel vs Agent Panel</h2>
 
 - Once you get logged into the VM and osTicket, it will direct you to the Agent Panel

![osticket Step 1a](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29d1c80b-8b67-4339-be91-16db4941e3e4)

 - Noticed the highlighted area that says "Admin Panel" and selected it.

![osticket Step 1b](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/768b1824-c6fc-4362-9bbf-e963c16f8544)

- Notice that under this panel, it lists "Dashboard", "Settings", "Manage", "Email", and "Agents". This is where we will be primarily working today with this project.

- Admin Panel - This is used by the System Admin to configure settings on the backend.

- Agent Panel - This is used by the Help Desk Agents or Support Specialists to view and work on tickets.

<h2>Section 2 - Roles</h2>

- We are going to create a Role called "Supreme Admin" and give it every permission we can. (In real life, this is bad to do, but for practice purposes, it's okay)

- Go hover your mouse over "Agents" and then select "Roles"

![osticket Step 2a](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7415f1b-294b-4a15-aba6-938923a7f318)

![osticket Step 2c](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4352cb7-898e-414d-902d-a1634a738a11)

<h2>Section 3 - Departments</h2>

- In this section, we are going to create a Department called "SysAdmins"

- Within the Admin Panel, click "Agents" > "Departments" > "Add New Department"

- Note: You will more than likely have to navigate back to Agents > Teams to see that the team is created. (At least I did)

![osticket Step 4c](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a49aac28-95aa-4c79-9da6-4d8a73d821bb)

- Before moving on to the next session, let's check to make sure a setting is turned off
- Go to "Settings" > "User" > and make sure the box that says "Require registration and login to create tickets" is unchecked
